### Contributing

If you are interested in contributing a feature, please open an issue first for discussion.

If you are interested in filing a bug, just open an issue. The clearer you are when you're filing, the better. (Nothing beats a submitting a merge request for a failing test!)

If you're interested in fixing a bug there's no need to open an issue, you can just submit a merge request with a fix.

All merge requests are related to only 1 issue, so don't submit a merge request that touches on more than 1 section.

### Committing

We follow the commit message guidelines set forth by the AngularJS 2's github contribution guidelines, check them out [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#user-content--commit-message-guidelines)
